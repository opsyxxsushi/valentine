            Honestly, I like the way you talk, and <span class="highlight">I love how you laugh</span> when we VC. 
            It’s the kind of laugh that happens without thinking — real, effortless. 
            I like how you don’t come with bad stories or rumors like <span class="pink-text">other girls.</span> 
            There are a lot of things I never said out loud, but the truth is I feel calm and genuinely happy when I’m <span class="circle-text">with you.</span> 
            I don’t talk to anyone the way I talk to you. My friends told me to give up on you, <span class="underline-text">but I never did.</span> 
            I mean… why would I? 
            To be honest, I never want to <span class="pink-text">give up</span> on you, even when I know I might not have a chance. 
            There’s nothing to lose, right? I was never mad when you left me on <span class="highlight">delivered</span> — not even a little. 
            At the end of the day, you always replied, and that was enough for me. 
            Sometimes I get jealous of Bryce and Ricky. I wonder how they got you. 
            But when I really think about it, they’re probably a hundred times better than me. 
            Still, I like how you’re always friendly, how you somehow end up by my side. 
            And honestly… just tell me what you want. <strong>I’ll be that for you.</strong>
